Ever since I was a kid, I have been curious about mutations.
0:08
I think certain movies may have had an impact; I used to imagine mutations with amazing abilities.
0:13
But, there was also a lot I didn’t understand.
0:17
Let me explain.
0:18
Many people understand that a mutation is a change of genetic material---more specifically
0:24
a change within a nucleic acid.
0:27
RNA and DNA are both types of nucleic acids.
0:30
Therefore, anything with RNA or DNA can have a mutation.
0:34
That means animals- and that definitely includes humans- also plants, fungi, protists, bacteria,
0:40
Archeaa- they can all have mutations.
0:43
Additionally, so can viruses.
Neutral mutations
0:46
Many mutations can be neutral in effect.
0:48
You can see this codon codes for the amino acid leucine.
0:52
But if it experiences this particular silent mutation, even though a base has been altered,
0:58
it still codes for leucine.
1:00
It did not change the amino acid.
1:03
Mutations can also be harmful or helpful.
1:06
But it’s important to understand that mutations are random.
1:09
The organism can’t “will” itself to get a certain mutation.
1:13
You can learn more about this in our natural selection video where we talk about how a
1:17
bacterium may already possess a helpful mutation that allows it to survive an antibiotic, but
1:24
the bacterium didn’t “will” itself to mutate to get this certain mutation.
1:29
Ok, so again, mutations are random.
1:32
But there can be factors that can make mutations more likely to occur.
1:36
External factors like certain types of chemicals or excessive radiation or internal factors
1:42
like an event that causes a problem with DNA replication in interphase.
1:48
During interphase, cells can replicate DNA before they divide.
1:52
So let’s discuss some different types of mutations.
Gene mutations
1:56
We’ll start with gene mutations.
1:58
DNA makes up genes and genes can code for proteins that influence different traits.
2:03
So when a mutation in DNA happens, which specifically means a change in one or more DNA bases, then
2:09
different proteins can be produced which can affect an organism’s traits.
2:14
In this example, we have fruit fly DNA.
2:17
Mutations could include substitution which means the wrong base is matched.
2:21
Insertion, which means an extra base (or bases) are added in.
2:26
There is also deletion, which means a base is removed.
2:29
Insertions and deletions have the potential to be especially dangerous.
2:34
Why?
2:35
Remember in protein synthesis, how we talked about how bases are read in threes?
2:39
Well if you add a base or remove a base, suddenly the number of bases total has changed.
2:46
And if you read the bases in threes---depending on where it happened---- everything that is
2:51
read afterwards could be affected.
2:54
We call this a frameshift mutation.
2:57
If you look at this frameshift example here where a single base has been inserted, you
3:01
can see now how the following codons---which have 3 bases each---are now all affected as
3:06
the reading frame has been shifted.
3:08
This example shows how it can lead to many amino acid changes.
Chromosome mutations
3:13
There are also chromosomal mutations.
3:15
Remember that chromosomes are made up of DNA and protein----highly organized---and they
3:20
have lots of genes on them.
3:22
The human chromosome number is 46 with 23 from an egg cell and 23 from a sperm cell.
3:28
This type of fruit fly here, however, has 8 chromosomes so 4 came from an egg cell and
3:33
4 came from a sperm cell.
3:35
Some examples of chromosomal mutations include duplication, where extra copies of genes are
3:41
generated.
3:42
Deletion, where some of the genetic material breaks off.
3:46
Inversion, when a broken chromosome segment gets inversed (which means reversed) and put
3:51
back on the chromosome.
3:53
Or translocation when a fragment from one chromosome breaks off and attaches to another
3:59
chromosome.
4:00
There’s more mutations than what we covered of course, but the idea is that there are
4:04
many different kinds of changes that can happen.
4:06
If a mutation is going to happen, we already mentioned that there are especially vulnerable
4:12
times such as during DNA replication but also there are other times too…like meiosis.
4:18
In fruit flies and other animals, meiosis makes sperm and egg cells that can have half
4:24
the number of chromosomes as the organism.
4:26
However, sometimes those chromosomes don’t separate completely.
4:31
We call this nondisjunction.
4:33
This can result in an egg or sperm cell that has too many or too few chromosomes.
4:38
It’s possible for a mutation to be passed down to an offspring.
4:43
Consider a protist with a mutation.
4:46
Many protists reproduce asexually, and when they divide, the daughter cell can inherit
4:50
the same mutation.
4:52
A fruit fly, which reproduces sexually, can pass a mutation to its offspring if that mutation
4:58
is found in the genetic material of the sperm or egg cell.
5:01
You may wonder why we’ve been mentioning fruit flies so much?
5:05
Well, they’re AWESOME.
5:06
But, also, it turns out that fruit fly mutations---and how they are inherited---are frequently studied.
5:12
We have some links in the video description for more info.
5:15
These studied mutations can also occur in humans, and we’ll give a gene mutation example
5:20
of a substitution in the case of sickle cell anemia.
Human mutations
5:24
First- a little background.
5:26
Hemoglobin is a protein in your red blood cells that helps you carry oxygen.
5:30
But in the disorder sickle cell anemia, the gene that codes for hemoglobin is mutated.
5:35
If you inherit two copies of this gene (one from each parent), you can have this disorder.
5:41
This disorder can make it difficult for your red blood cells to carry oxygen because the
5:46
shape of the red blood cell is affected from this mutated hemoglobin protein.
5:51
This can lead to anemia and other problems.
5:54
While unfortunately there is not a cure for this disorder yet, the good news is that treatment
5:59
for this disorder has greatly improved.
6:03
Another thing to mention, if an individual only inherits one copy of the mutated gene
6:08
from one parent, they are a carrier but they don’t officially have the disease.
6:13
Usually they do not have symptoms.
6:15
But those that are carriers appear to have a protective factor against malaria.
6:21
Malaria is a disease caused by a protist that can be transmitted by mosquitoes.
6:27
These individuals can still get malaria, but their symptoms are often less severe.
6:33
We should mention that studying mutations and genetic disorders is a large and important
6:38
field right now.
6:40
Genetic counselors work to help families that may be affected by genetic disorders.
